This project aims to provide the user with deeper insight on best fit models for fitting a curve given a dataset. The example I will seek to model and fit is the frequency of galaxies given a certain distance. How I aim to implement this is by importing data published by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and using different fitting methods to best fit the data. I will try my best to walk through each step of the process.
